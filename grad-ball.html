										<h1>Parents’ anger as student refused entry to university Grad Ball after dropping out in 1st year</h1>

									</header>

									<p>A livid father claims his son was refused entry to the finalists’ end of year Grad Ball after dropping out of university during his first year in 2018.</p>

								  <p>The family had “forked out a small fortune” for a tuxedo, winklepickers, and a limousine so that the student could attend his final hurrah at Bantshire, a top ten university when ordered alphabetically.</p>

									<p>The student, 24, who now works as a freelance TikTok influencer (276 followers), says he was issued no prior warning from the university that he would not be able to attend.</p>

									<p>The family described their son as “absolutely devastated” saying it “embarrassed him in front of all his friends he might have made if he hadn’t dropped out during his second week four years ago”.</p>

									<p>The family, who were key workers during the pandemic as social media managers, are now asking for compensation in the form of a honorary degree from the university.</p>

									<p>Bantshire’s Vice-Chancellor Vince Chancelier (He/VC) said: “Nid wyf yn y swyddfa ar hyn o bryd.”</p>

									<p>The family later posted to Facebook, “hun its discusting. bantshire promise to throb knowledge & pulse excellence. well, im throbbin fumin. this is an insult to free speech by the radical left. we’ll be raising this with educashun security Chell Donelan MP.”</p>

									<p>ENDS.</p>

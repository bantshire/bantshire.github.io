										<h1>Novelty Bantshire Certificates</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/christmas.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Suprise a friend or colleague this Christmas with a Bantshire Honorary Degree Certificate* - the perfect Secret Santa gift!</p>
									<p>*novelty item only, not a real certificate. Obvs.</p>
									<h2>Woah, how!?</h2>
									<p>All I ask for is that you make a small donation to a charity I’d like to support through this campaign - <a href="https://www.aidafghanistanforeducation.org/">Aid Afghanistan for Education</a></b>.
									</p>Aid Afghanistan for Education has 12 schools in 6 provinces in Afghanistan, that provide accelerated education for 3,000+ marginalised women and girls. An educated woman is more likely to survive childbirth. She marries later, earns a higher income, and has children who attend school, are vaccinated, well nourished, and have access to water and adequate sanitation.</p>
									<p>In 2018, Aid Afghanistan for Education was awarded a UNESCO International Literacy Prizes for its efforts in providing learning opportunities for women and girls through their ‘Accelerated Education for Marginalized Women and Girls’ programme.</p>
									<p>The recommended donation is £5, but really I'd be happy with however much you can afford. £4.50 would also be fine. It’s up to you.</p>
									<h2>Why?</h2>
									<p>I’ve had so much fun building our Bantshire community over the last 7 months, I’d like to try and harness that power for good whilst I’m still riding the higher education wave.</p>
									<p>Wouldn’t it be great to know that Bantshire fans have funded an Afghan pupil’s education for 2020.<p/>
									<p>The charity is well established, and I’m confident that the money raised will be spent wisely.</p>
									<h2>Follow these steps to order <b>(sorry, ordering is now closed)</b></h2>
									<p><ol>
									<li>Make a donation via <a href="https://www.globalgiving.org/fundraisers/bantshire/">www.globalgiving.org/fundraisers/bantshire</a> <b>(sorry, certificate ordering is now closed)</b></li>
									<li>Then, fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/sjgv4duJSS59JfMM9">this Google Form to order the certificate (use the same name as your donation so I can match them up)</a> <b>(sorry, certificate ordering is now closed)</b></li>
									<li>All certificates will be posted at the same time in the first week of December</li></ol></p>
									<p>Due to budget and time constraints, I’ll have to limit the number of posted certificates to 50. This page and the Google Form will be updated when this target is reached.<p>
									<h2>How do I know this is genuine?</h2>
									<p>All donations are being made straight to charity through the website <a href="https://www.globalgiving.org/fundraisers/bantshire/">globalgiving.org</a>, so you know I’m not going to be making any money out of this. And you have my word I’ll post out the certificates - I don’t want to tarnish the Bantshire brand.</p>
									<h2>Data protection</h2>
									<p>All data collected through this campaign will be deleted at the end of it. This isn’t come sort of elaborate Cambridge Analytica type scam. But if you’d prefer, I will email the certificate rather than post - just make a note on the Google form. We recommend that if you want the certificate posted it is sent to people’s work addresses.</p>
									<p>See the Google Form for more infomation on data protection, yeah?</p>
									<h2>A thank you</h2>
									<p>A thank you to our sponsor for helping to get this idea off the ground, and funding the printing and posting of the certificates.</p>

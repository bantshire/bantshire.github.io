										<h1>Dress-down Friday</h1>
									</header>

<p>It was dress-down Friday, and Marketing Assistant Jenson had decided to surprise his colleagues by wearing his most outrageous floral Hawaiian shirt, paired with tailor-made work shorts that were cut off a good few inches above the knee. But little did Jenson know that he’d been delegated a last minute invite to the bimonthly Faculty of Commerce management meeting. </p>

<p>Fucks sake, Jenson thought to himself as he dashed through the drizzle to the Vince Cable Building. </p>

<p>Once inside, he had a quick splash of Old Spice and pulled the meeting room door handle, rattling the frame. No luck. It was a push door. He shoved it forcefully, slamming it against the wall behind, and strolled through.</p>

<p>He sat down, making sure there was an empty chair on either side of him to act as a buffer to the next person. The Dean’s Assistant, Bev, stared at Jenson. In the far corner Jeff and Geoff were helping themselves to a lukewarm coffee left over from the previous meeting, and Kelly was sat opposite, wistfully staring out of the window at the concrete wall outside. </p>

<p>Jenson pretended to check his work emails. </p>

<p>The meeting finally started, 15 minutes late, once the Dean has turned up with a Matcha Pumpkin Latte. He announced that he’d brought donuts, and laughed. He hadn’t brought donuts. </p>

<p>Bev distributed reams of background material, printed in full colour and on one side only. </p>

<p>The first topic of discussion was undergraduate recruitment. The Dean was agitated that his new course, a BA in Music and Leisure Centre Management, had failed to attract any applicants. This was clearly a Marketing issue, as his desk-based research last May had proven there was a gap in the market. He fixed Jenson a long hard stare as he sipped his latte. </p>

<p>At this exact same moment, there was a loud noise from above as a leg came crashing through the ceiling, followed by a cry of “argghfucksakesrgg”. As the dust settled, the leg retrieved itself back into the ceiling, and there was the sound of crawling. </p>

<p>A few seconds passed and there was a further creak, and through the ceiling fell Chief IT Engineer Barry, landing on Bev’s lap.</p>

<p>The End.</p>

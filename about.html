									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Bantshire was founded in 1969 by <em>[name redacted due to ongoing court proceedings]</em>. It was the 25th member of the Russell Group, until it was expelled in 1970 for being a bit shit. However, it has turned itself right-the-fuck around and now ranks No.1 for Canteen Facilities in the CEF 2020, and brings joy to thousands of punters via its <a href="https://twitter.com/bantshireuni">Twitter website</a>. Bantshire’s current Vice-Chancellor is <a href="https://twitter.com/BantshireUni/status/1136870329379368960">Vince Chancelier (He/VC)</a>.</p>

											<h2>Meet the team</h2></header>
											<p>Bantshire’s Marketing Team is one of the best in the country, winning praise (but no fucking awards) from <a href="https://twitter.com/BantshireUni/status/1149372222873767937">HEIST</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CASE_Europe/status/1167099190301876226">CASE</a>. Meet the team:</p>
											<h3>Chief Pixel Arranger</h3>
											<p>"The team are putting the finishing touches to their 169 page 'brand guidelines' that no one will ever read."</p>
											<h3>Senior Shit Scribbler</h3>
											<p>“If I was a teenage girl, I’d want to hear about The University of Bantshire on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.”</p>
											<h3>Veteran Meme Artisan</h3>
											<p>“Our social media team draw straws to see who gets to manage social on Ed Balls Day.”</p>
											<h3>Social Media Ninja</h3>
											<p>“Our social team’s excitement about the massive engagement over Clearing was short-lived after they realised it was pretty much all complaints.”</p>

									<h2>Social media</h2></header>
									<p>As well as being on the <a href="https://twitter.com/BantshireUni">Twitter website</a> and TV channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2MePTZtgDph0i6Ia0yo02Q">YouTube</a>, Bantshire are on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BantshireUni">Facebook</a> and have an inactive presence on <a href="https://instagram.com/bantshireuni">Instagram</a> (still worth a follow).</p>
									<p>Bantshire SU are also on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/bantshiresu">@BantshireSU</a>, for some fucking reason. Officers Sam (he/him), Sam (she/her), and Jeff (Jeff/Geoff) put the ‘you’ into ‘SU’.</p>

									<h2>Covering our arse</h2></header>
									<p>Bantshire University is run by an absolute ledge who works in higher education. It's totes obvs a parody account and not intended to upset or troll anyone - you snowflake. We love higher education, but equally enjoy the idea that in an alternate universe there is a university as bad as Bantshire. Or maybe in this universe.</p>
									<p>Names, characters, businesses, places, events, locales, and incidents are either the products of the author's imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual any of the above, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental - including our Vice-Chancellor, Professor Vincent Chancelier. Bantshire is not intended as a substitute for the expert advice of marketing and communications professionals. Most images are sourced from <a href="https://www.unsplash.com">unsplash.com</a>.</p>
									<p>To be honest, I doubt any of that would cover us, but worth a crack.</p>

<header class="major">
									<h2>About this website</h2></header>
									<p>I've gone about making this website all wrong. I downloaded a free template from <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>, and then have been using fucking Notepad to turn it into this. I am hosting it on GitHub. Fuck knows why. Apart from it being free.</p>

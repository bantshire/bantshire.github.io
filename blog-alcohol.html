										<h1>Only a quarter of students satisfied with hangovers</h1>
									</header>

								<p>Only a quarter of students in the UK were satisfied with their hangovers during the pandemic.</p>

									<p>An annual survey found that the majority of students felt they had missed out on quality university hangovers as advertised on Hollyoaks or The Inbetweeners, whilst only 3% of students said they were thrown out of their students’ unions after a punch-up with security since March 2020, down 89% on 2019.</p>

									<p>These were the lowest-ever hangover satisfaction ratings in the survey going back to 1854, in a report produced by a higher education drink tank.</p>

									<p>One student said: “Being drunk on The Sims University just isn’t the same”.</p>

									<p>Another said: “Drinking a bottle of Strongbow whilst self-isolating with a household bubble you despise just isn’t worth £9,250”.</p>

									<p>Responding to the survey, the oFFS urged institutions to be more transparent with students about how much face-to-toilet action they are likely to receive next academic year so that they have “realistic expectations of one-night stands they will come to regret”.</p>

									<p>While some universities have said they will turn a blind eye to piss-ups in the campus woods, other university websites are vague about their pitchers and £1 shots.</p>

									<p>Education Secretary Wavin Gilliamson, responding to the survey, suggested universities in England should replace campus bars with statues of the Queen.</p>

									<p>Ends.</p>
